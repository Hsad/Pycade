I understand your concern Princess, but unfortunately I cannot obligue.

The knights who have captured your brother are known for their viciousness
and it would not be fitting of me as a protector of hte royal family if I
allowed you to put yourself in harm's way.

Do not worry.  I assure you we will see to the prince's swift return.
